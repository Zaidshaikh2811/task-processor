# Task Processor

A background task processing system built with Node.js + Docker. It supports worker + API components, and allows scheduling or executing asynchronous jobs reliably.

## Features

* Separate API and Worker services for better scalability.
* Handles asynchronous tasks via worker processes.
* Dockerized setup for both API and worker.
* Docker Compose to orchestrate the services.
* (Add more if applicable: e.g. logging, retries, scheduled tasks, etc.)

---

## Architecture

A high-level view:

* **API** — exposes endpoints for creating tasks, checking status, etc.
* **Worker** — picks up tasks submitted via the API (or via queue) and processes them.
* **Docker** — each component can run in its own container; `docker-compose` brings them together.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your development / server machine:

* Node.js (version X or above)
* npm (or yarn)
* Docker
* Docker Compose

---

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zaidshaikh2811/task-processor.git
   cd task-processor
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Setup configuration (environment variables, etc.) — see [Configuration](#configuration).

---

## Configuration

You’ll need to configure environment variables for both the API and the Worker. Typical variables might include:

| Environment Variable                                                     | Purpose                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`                                                                   | Port on which the API listens                           |
| `QUEUE_URL` or similar                                                   | For queue-based task handling (if using such)           |
| `DB_CONNECTION`                                                          | Database connection URI (if tasks are stored/persisted) |
| Other service-specific configs (retries, timeouts, logging levels, etc.) |                                                         |

You can use `.env` files or other secrets management as per your deployment setup.

---

## Usage

* To start the API locally:

  ```bash
  npm run start:api
  ```

* To run the worker locally:

  ```bash
  npm run start:worker
  ```

* Creating a task (via API):
  *(Provide endpoint details, request formats, etc.)*

* Checking task status: *(if applicable)*

---

## Docker & Deployment

To run using Docker / Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will build the Docker images for both the API and Worker and start them.

### Dockerfiles

* `Dockerfile.api` — builds the API container.
* `Dockerfile.worker` — builds the worker container.

---

## File Structure

Here’s a breakdown of major files / directories:

```
.
├── api/ or src/           # API related code (routes, controllers, etc.)
├── worker/                # Worker / background processing code
├── Dockerfile.api         # Docker configuration for the API
├── Dockerfile.worker      # Docker configuration for the worker
├── docker-compose.yml     # Compose file to spin up all services
├── index.js               # Entry point
├── package.json           # Dependencies and scripts
└── README.md              # This documentation
```

(Modify based on actual directory names in your repo.)

## Contributing

If you’d like to contribute, here are a few guidelines:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`).
3. Make changes, add tests if applicable.
4. Commit and push.
5. Open a pull request, briefly describing your changes.

Please adhere to consistent code style, write meaningful commits and tests for new functionality.

If you want, I can generate a more specific README by inspecting the code (endpoints, tasks, etc.). Do you want me to do that?
